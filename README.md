# Resumed:
The app is in the foreground and actively responding to user input. This is the normal state for an app that is being used. 
# Inactive:
The app is in a transitional state, such as when a phone call is received or when the user switches to another app. The app is still running in the background but not accepting user input. 
# Paused:
The app is in the background and not visible to the user. It's still consuming memory but not actively processing user input. 
# Detached:
The app is being terminated and its UI is being removed. This state is often followed by the app's process being killed.
